/**
 * JavaScript Initializers
 * 
 * JavaScript (JS) initializers execute logic before and after a Blazor app loads.
 * JS initializers are useful in the following scenarios:
 * 
 * - Customizing how a Blazor app loads.
 * - Initializing libraries before Blazor starts up.
 * - Configuring Blazor settings.
 * 
 * To define a JS initializer, add a JS module to the project named {NAME}.lib.module.js, 
 * where the {NAME} placeholder is the assembly name, library name, or package identifier.
 * 
 * Place the file in the project's web root, which is typically the wwwroot folder.
